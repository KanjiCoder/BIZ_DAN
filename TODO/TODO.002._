        1. Dan should not explode when he intercepts haystack

        2. The invincibility period maybe should shake dan
           too because somethings the flashing can't be
           seen because of being out of vsync maybe ?
        
        3. Invincibility period should probably be shorter
           the faster the level is moving . So as you
           beat more levels , you get less invincibility
           period.

           OTHERWISE , you could be INVINCIBLE FOR THE
           ENTIRE LEVEL , when the level is going fast .
