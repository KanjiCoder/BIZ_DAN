
    NOTES FOR NEXT GAME :

    1. Create 1 monolithic file will sections :

        __CONST__

                    c_some_const_define_macro_here
                    ( or immutable data if no #define )

        __DATA___

                    d_some_data_name_here

        __FUNC___  <-- Static functions , NOT METHODS

                    F_SOMEUTILITY_DOTHETHING()

        __METHOD__ <-- functions that are procedural 
                       implementations of member methods
                       within object scripts

                       EXAMPLE :
                       F_DANMETHODS_KILL( ) <-- Kill Dan

                       Probably use "F_" for function rather
                       than "M_" for method , to avoid 
                       over proliferation of prefixes .

                       And to not get confused with m_ for
                       "member of struct" variable .
